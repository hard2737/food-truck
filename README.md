# EstÃ©e Lauder's Coding Challenge
[Github description](https://github.com/peck/engineering-assessment)

Top of mind I'll do this in NextJS so that I can deploy the results in a publicly available site.
- [data provided](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data) in web page view
- [data provided](https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/rqzj-sfat/rows.csv) in csv hosted on the web as plain text
- [data provided](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peck/engineering-assessment/main/Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit.csv) from coding challenge repo
- Data Notes
    - Initial observations: the file appears to be out of date (meaning I downloaded both and ran them through Beyond Compare to check), so I'll prefer the online version hosted through SF government site. The data is 489 lines, so the size of the data isn't particularly big.
    - [more about the data](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b/about_data) shows that it was updated Aug 29th and is published daily
    - I need to figure out how to load csv from a fetch
    - ~~[csv-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csv-parser) may be worth using given that dataset's size. Performance of loading this data for ever page load of whatever will be built will be a tradeoff. There are a lot of better options for how to handle this data being refreshed, but I'll go with live data for now.~~
    - I found papaparse, it will do
    - I found weird mapping issues while getting data, particularly for fields like "Fire Prevention Districts", "Police Districts", "Supervisor Districts", "Zip Codes", "Neighborhoods (old)" in my initial hacking to figure out simple data loading. See the notes in the code about this
- Design Notes
    - Let's build a simple fun list with pertinent info
        - I found an API/query string param for the blocklot field, cool, let's use that later
        - I think users would want to list the vendors and search by the menu
        - I'll build a simple list with search capabilities for the menu items
        - Also, if the permit is denied or something, let's let the user know
        - I'll set this up to be able to do other cities as best as I can
        - I had the idea to set this up so that data is cached in localStorage based on the date. There could be some cool functionality to be had looking back over time at what the data said in the past: *__Food Truck Time Machine!__*
        - I pared down the field list from what is given in CSV to what I thought were the most relevant fields
        - I created a model for what's in the CSV data and one for what app really cares about
        - I created cards for each of the vendors
        - I created search functionality
        - In the amount of time that I had to dedicated to this it's hardly a scalable solution, but it works pretty well
        - I struggled late to get unit testing up and running in jest. It is my biggest regret in terms of tradeoffs.
- Running notes
    - You should be able to run `nvm use && pnpm install && pnpm dev` to run this project


### My initial setup
- `npm i -g pnpm`
- `pnpm setup`
- `source ~/.zshrc`
- `pnpm i -g next`
- `cd ~/dev && mkdir food-truck && cd food-truck  && npx create-next-app@latest .`
- `echo "v20.17.0" > .nvmrc` to give other devs a hint of which version of node to use (they can just run `nvm use` and be on the correct version)
- `nvm use` to practice what we preached in the previous line
- I should have started setting up jest right here, but I didn't and ran out of time for proper unit testing

### Boilerplate Setup 
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


#### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

#### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

#### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
